To connect your git to a github repository:

Step 1 : Create a gthub repository on the site.
Give it a name,description and make it public (public allows easy pull and push)

Step 2 : Copy the repository name. It will be like - git@github.com:ownername/repositoryname.git
NOTE : ownername and repository, copy it  carefully.

Step 3 : Go to your git repository on your system and type the command in your git bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:ownername/repositoryname.git
NOTE : origin is the name of the online hosted github repository

You have succesfully connected your git repository to the online hosted github repository.

To Check for the remote repositories:
git remote

To check for the remote repositories in detail:
git remote -v

NOTE : you will not be able to push or pull anything right now as you are not a accepted user yet. For that you need to get permission from github.

FOR THAT,
1) Go to github settings.
2) Go to SSH and GPG keys.
3) Create a new SSH key. Give it a title and a SSH key.

NOW, To generate a SSH key google search ssh keys github or follow the steps below.

1) Creating a SSH key.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c "your_email@example.com"
and press Enter Enter to skip the passphrase dialogs.
Your key will be generated.

2) Adding this key to ssh-agent
run this command to make sure your ssh agent is working
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)

Now add the key by this command
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

3) Adding key to github
Run the command
$ tail ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
it will show you your ssh key
Copy it and paste it where the ssh key was asked (go above on step 3) Create a new SSH key.)

Now you can Push or pull your files.
